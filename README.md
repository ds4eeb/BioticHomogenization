## Using this tutorial
_Requirements: This tutorial assumes that you have a computer with an internet connection and with R and RStudio installed._

### 1.0 Copy the tutorial to your computer

* Visit [https://github.com/ds4eeb/BioticHomogenization](https://github.com/ds4eeb/BioticHomogenization) (_you're here already!_)  
* Click the green “Code” button, then select “Download ZIP” from the menu that appears.  

### 2.0 Open the tutorial

* Find the downloaded BioticHomogenization-main.zip file on your computer.  
* Double click to unzip it (or otherwise unzip it… this might depend on your operating system)  
* Open the folder that was created (“BioticHomogenization-main”)  
* Open the BioticHomogenization.Rproj by double clicking it. This will open RStudio.  
* From within RStudio, open tutorial.Rmd from the Files pane (usually in the lower right corner).  
* Read the tutorial and follow the instructions 🙂  

Hooray!  
If you’re not familiar enough with RStudio to do this, please call an instructor over and we’ll be happy to help!
